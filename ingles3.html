        <h1><div class="subtitulo">RULE #1</div></h1> <br> <br> 

        

        TREAT OTHERS THE WAY YOU WISH TO BE TREATED The good old Golden Rule says it all: empathy, tolerance and peace. <br> 
        
        This principle teaches you to love yourself and love others. It spans cultures and faiths and is a universal age old concept <br> 
        
        which can’t fail! <br> <br> 

        Past simple: He treated others the way he wished to be treated. <br> <br> 
        Present perfect: She has treated others the way she wishes to be treated. <br> <br>  <br> 



        <h1><div class="subtitulo">RULE #2</div></h1> <br> <br> 


        LISTEN TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY, NOT TO SPEAK Engage in dialogue with an open mind and the <br> <br> 
        
        real will to listen to others. Only then will you be able to understand each other and build bridges. Change cannot happen and <br> <br> 
        
        peace cannot be established if people are unable to communicate with others; to listen to their experiences and views and show <br> <br> 

        empathy, understanding and compassion. <br> <br> <br> 


        Past simple: He listened to hear what others had to say, not to speak. <br> <br>
        Present perfect: She has listened to hear what others have to say, not to speak. <br> <br> <br> 



        <h1><div class="subtitulo">RULE #3</div></h1> <br> <br>
        
        ACCEPT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION We all have different opinions and we may not all agree on the same things. Building <br> <br> 
        
        compromise and mutual understanding is incredibly important. Sometimes we simply need to agree to disagree and recognise <br> <br>   
        
        that there are different beliefs and forms of expression other than our own. <br> <br> <br> 

        Past simple: He accepted the difference of opinion and moved forward with mutual understanding. <br> <br>  
        Present perfect: She has accepted the difference of opinion and recognized other perspectives. <br> <br> <br> 


        <h1><div class="subtitulo">RULE #4</div></h1> <br> <br>

        DO NOT FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE  Violence is never the answer. Peace can only be brought through free will, <br> <br> 
        
        dialogue, empathy and forgiveness. Do not stoop to same level as someone who is violent and therefore continue the vicious cycle. <br> <br> 
        
        This does not change anything. <br> <br> <br>

        Past simple: He did not fight violence with violence, and instead chose dialogue and understanding. <br> <br> 
        Present perfect: She has not fought violence with violence, seeking peace through empathy and forgiveness instead. <br> <br> <br> 


        <h1><div class="subtitulo">RULE #5</div></h1> <br> <br>

        ACCEPT THAT IDENTITY IS FLUID  Any one person can have multiple aspects to their identity. Identity comprises many <br> <br> 
        
        elements such as nationality, cultural-linguistic origin, age and religious beliefs. Identity can and does change, taking on many <br> <br> 
        
        new forms and means of personal expression as we learn new languages, move home, adopt new beliefs, marry into a different <br> <br> 
        
        tradition and experience life! Do not put people into a box. Avoid categorising people according to and us vs. them narrative and <br> <br> 
        
        remember: we are all singular individuals with unique experiences. Such approaches and narratives are highly divisive <br> <br> 
        
        and unproductive. <br> <br> <br> 

        Past simple: He accepted that identity was fluid and embraced the changes in his own life. <br> <br> 
        Present perfect: She has accepted that identity is fluid and has grown through new experiences and beliefs. <br> <br> <br> 


        <h1><div class="subtitulo">RULE #6</div></h1> <br> <br>

        AVOID STEREOTYPES  Take people for the individuals they are. Avoid misconceptions, stereotypes and toxic narratives and get <br> <br> 
        
        to know a person instead. This will avoid offence, misunderstandings and ultimately help you to create a real bond with others <br> <br>
        
        based on true understanding, empathy and trust. After all, no one likes to be judged – especially from the outside. <br> <br> 

        Past simple: He avoided stereotypes and got to know people for who they truly were. <br> <br> 
        Present perfect: She has avoided stereotypes and built deeper connections through empathy and understanding. <br> <br> <br>
